## Overview
Our game is a bird’s eye view-oriented game that simulates a baseball game. 2 players control their own teams, which will alternate pitching and batting. The batter is controlled using the mouse. A swinging mechanic allows the batter to hit the ball. If the hit is good, it will go further out for the catcher to try and catch, while a strike or foul will work as they do in a normal baseball game. The other player first pitches the ball. If the batter hits it, an outfield player must run to try and pick it up or catch it using WASD. Then they can press a number key to specify which base to throw the ball to. Most rules simply follow traditional baseball rules. A scoreboard on the left side displays crucial data points and a screen on the right has a flowing list of major events in the game.

## Instructions
Player 1 controls the P-key, the number keys, and the WASD keys. Player 2 controls the Mouse.
First, Player 1 presses P to pitch the ball, and player 2 swings when he thinks is appropriate.
Depending how the swing goes, there will be a strike, foul, or good hit.
In the event of a good hit, the batter will automatically start running.
Player 1 should use WASD to control the pitcher to try and catch the ball.
If the ball is caught, Player 1 uses the 1-2-3-4 keys to throw the ball to the base they want.
If the ball makes it before the running player, that one will be out.
The roles of Player 1 and Player 2 switch when appropriate(3 outs).
When the game gets to 9 innings, a winner is declared or it goes into over time.

Pressing 9 takes you to the end of the game with 9 innings, 2 strikes and 2 outs.
